<!-- Excerpt Start -->

As Plutus matures, a new community-driven documentation site will offer a valuable source of documentation from devs building on Cardano

<!-- Excerpt End -->


Input Output Global (IOG) seeks to empower open source and community-driven development. Communities enriching the space are the cornerstone for technological adoption and success.

Similarly, the value of community-driven resources - documentation, tools, etc. - cannot be understated. No single team can match thousands of brains from the community. The best and more relevant documentation and content tend to emerge from people creating value for the ecosystem.

The Cardano blockchain enjoys a growing list of community content resources, managed and curated by a variety of players. The Cardano Community Discord channel serves as a focal point for the developer community. Cardano Stack Exchange goes a step further, driven by community members with some IOG team members contributing. Essential Cardano (currently in public beta), provides a curated platform for community content, powered by an open GitHub repo. The Cardano Foundation's developer portal provides another valuable jump off point to reach multiple resources.

Plutus Community Docs (PCD) is the latest addition to this growing list of community-centric platforms created by the community and for the community, meeting the rising demand for detailed technical content.

PCD will become a central source that promotes & gathers the most valuable developer documentation ranging from setting up an environment to DApp development, best practices & open-source community tools.
Continuously collating Cardanoâ€™s technical content

There now exists a wealth of Plutus-related documentation.

There are Plutus-related YouTube channels, for example, and hundreds of GitHub repos created and maintained by the community.

Cardano's design ethos and the community's passion enable a strong focus on building secure solutions with real-world utility.

New programming languages require support through documentation, tutorials, user guides, and a community of experts and mentors driving learning across the community. This is a growing trend since the first cohort of Plutus Pioneers. Students have stepped-up and carried the pioneering flag with avid members sharing their solutions in the form of guides and one-to-one conversations on Discord.
